## Definition
A debut stream is the VTuber’s inaugural broadcast: the avatar reveal, personality introduction, and community welcome. Debuts often feature countdowns, trailers, and special interactions.

## Typical elements
- **Trailer** : showcases the avatar, concept art, and tone.  
- **Presentation** : rules, schedule, and persona overview.  
- **Donations** : heavy Super Chat, bits, or tips for supporters.  
- **Collabs** : mentors or guests to boost reach.

A successful debut combines packaging (audio, visuals, story) with community excitement.
