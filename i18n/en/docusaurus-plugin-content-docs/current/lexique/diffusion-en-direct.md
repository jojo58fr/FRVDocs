## Definition
Live streaming is the simultaneous broadcast of a program as it is produced, allowing real-time interaction. In VTubing, live shows are the heart of community building: viewers react via chat, donations, stickers, and the streamer responds instantly.

## Elements
- **Platforms** : YouTube Live, Twitch, Bilibili, Niconico.  
- **Chat** : moderation, bots (Streamlabs, Nightbot), auto filters.  
- **Monetization** : Super Chat, channel memberships, bits, third-party tips (Streamlabs, Tipeee).  
- **Production** : OBS scenes, overlays, avatar tracking, voice changers.

Live sessions keep audiences engaged through immediacy and spontaneity.
