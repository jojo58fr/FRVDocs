## Definition
A 3D model is the polygonal version of an avatar created with vertices, edges, and faces inside a modeling software. VTubers who need full-body movement and dynamic lighting often use 3D models built in Blender, Maya, or Unity.

## Production pipeline
- **Modeling** : sculpting, topology, and optimization.  
- **Texturing** : painting textures and shaders (PBR, cel-shading).  
- **Rigging & animation** : adding a skeleton and blendshapes for expressions and motion.  
- **Live use** : exporting to Unity or Unreal Engine for real-time streaming (VTube Studio 3D, Luppet).

3D avatars enable full 360° rotation, dynamic lighting, and physics-ready interactions for concerts and clips.
