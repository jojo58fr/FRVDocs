## Definition
Live2D is a technology from Live2D Co., Ltd that animates 2D illustrations through morphing. It keeps the look of the original art while allowing movements for the body, head, eyes and mouth.

## Process
- **PSD prep** : separate elements (eyes, mouth, limbs, accessories).  
- **Parameters** : create deformation points, rotation, and tilt.  
- **Export** : use Cubism, VTube Studio, or Unity for live tracking.

Live2D is popular because it delivers an anime-style result without the cost of a true 3D model.
