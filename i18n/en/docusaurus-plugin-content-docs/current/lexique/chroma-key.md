## Definition
Chroma key is a post-production method that isolates a subject filmed against a solid color (usually green or blue) and replaces its background with digital scenery. VTubers rely on chroma key to separate their capture setup from animated overlays.

## Use cases
- Green/blue screen setup in OBS, Streamlabs, or VTube Studio.  
- Enables immersive backdrops and dynamic scenes.  
- Common in collaboration streams or themed events.
