## Definition
An alternate universe (AU) is a fictional or modified version of a VTuber character's story, used to tell new scenarios without altering the core narrative. Examples include pirate-themed AUs, historical AUs, or collaborative settings where characters swap roles.

## Why VTubers use AUs
- They allow creators to experiment with new story arcs and crossovers.  
- They reinforce community engagement through themed events.  
- They provide fresh contexts for concerts, roleplay, and special streams.

AU stories are a popular way to expand the lore around a VTuber without changing the canonical timeline.
