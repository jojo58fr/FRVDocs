## Definition
In digital contexts, an avatar is the visual and narrative representation of an internet user. VTubers rely on avatars to embody their character: the art style, proportions, expressions, and lore that make the streamer recognisable. Avatars can be male, female, non-binary, animal-themed, robotic, or completely imaginary.

## Design process
- **Turnarounds** : front, side and expression sheets.  
- **Technical prep** : separating layers for Live2D or exporting meshes for 3D.  
- **Evolution** : rebranding and updated skins keep the persona fresh.

## Why it matters
A compelling avatar strengthens the bond with the community and allows the creator to stay anonymous while building a strong visual brand.
