## Definition
A VTuber agency is typically a corporate network (often Japanese) that scouts, trains, and promotes virtual talents. Agencies handle contracts, technical support, marketing, merchandising, and concerts. Hololive Production, Nijisanji or VShojo supervise dozens of VTubers across languages while coordinating promotions, collaborations, and licensing.

## Operations
- **Recruitment** : auditions, voice tests, personality screening.  
- **Production** : avatar setup, studios, live teams.  
- **Promotion** : global marketing, merchandising, license management.  
- **Support** : moderation, administration, curated visibility on playlists, official clips, and events.

## Why it matters
Agencies lower the cost of production by sharing resources and guaranteeing quality. They allow creators from countries with fewer local resources to gain professional guidance.
