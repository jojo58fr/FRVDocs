## Definition
Video on demand (VOD) refers to recorded livestreams or edited videos that viewers can watch after the broadcast. VTubers publish VODs so fans can revisit special events or consume tutorials at their own pace.

## Typical use cases
- Platforms keep archives for several days/weeks (YouTube, Twitch).  
- VODs fuel highlights (short clips, best-of edits).  
- They serve as source material for subtitles, translations, and guides.
