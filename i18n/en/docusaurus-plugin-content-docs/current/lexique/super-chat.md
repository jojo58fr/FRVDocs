## Definition
Super Chat is a YouTube feature from 2017 that lets viewers pay between $1 and $500 to highlight a chat message during a live stream. The higher the amount, the longer the message stays pinned.

## Mechanics
- **Payment** : Google Pay or saved card.  
- **Visibility** : duration and color depend on the amount.  
- **Use** : streamers often read Super Chats aloud, turn them into challenges, or thank supporters.

Super Chat is a major direct revenue stream for VTubers outside advertisements.
