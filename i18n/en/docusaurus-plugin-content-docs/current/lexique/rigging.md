## Definition
Rigging is the process of building a virtual skeleton beneath a mesh to enable animation. Each bone is hierarchised, transmitting rotations to the associated vertices.

## VTubing usage
- **Bones** : spine, clavicle, arms, fingers, face.  
- **Constraints & physics** : dynamic rigs for hair or cloth.  
- **Blendshapes** : facial expressions.  
- **Retargeting** : adapt the rig to mocap or facial tracking input.

Rigging makes live animation smooth and avoids manual keyframing on every move.
