## Definition
A generation (or gen) is a cohort of VTubers introduced simultaneously by an agency. Each gen shares visual themes, colors, and marketing so the group release feels like an event.

## Why agencies use generations
- Builds hype around a collective reveal (Gen 0, Gen 1, etc.).  
- Encourages collaborations within the generation.  
- Simplifies content planning (concerts, group streams, merchandise).
